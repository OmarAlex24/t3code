# Remote access

Connect a phone, browser, or another desktop app to T3 Code running on a different
machine. That machine must stay running and reachable while you work.

## Sandbox environments

A sandbox is a cloud machine that runs its own T3 Code server. Open **Settings → Environments →
Add environment**, choose **Sandbox**, and enter an API key for Boat, Celesto, Daytona, Upstash, or Vercel. The server
creates the machine, installs T3 Code, exposes it on a public HTTPS URL, and pairs it. The new
environment reconnects like any other remote environment.

The sandbox gets none of this machine's logins unless you ask. **Use this machine's Claude setup**
appears when Claude here talks to a custom endpoint, and points Claude in the sandbox at the same
one. If that endpoint is a [CLIProxyAPI hub you connected](./usage.md#connect-a-cliproxyapi-hub),
the sandbox gets its own key on the hub, which T3 Code removes when you delete the sandbox;
otherwise this machine's Claude token is copied, and it stays valid after the sandbox is gone. The
sandbox must be able to reach that endpoint: one that only answers on your tailnet or local
network works here but not in a cloud sandbox, so let the sandbox
[join your tailnet](#private-endpoints-tailscale) or expose the endpoint publicly (for example with
Tailscale Funnel or Cloudflare Tunnel). The dialog warns when it can tell.
**Sign GitHub in with this machine's token** lets `gh` and `git` in the sandbox reach every
repository that token can. T3 Code also installs git, the GitHub CLI, and Claude Code when the
provider's image lacks them. Once the sandbox is ready, the dialog lists what was set up; sign Codex
in from the sandbox's **Settings → Providers**.

For Vercel, create an access token at vercel.com/account/settings/tokens; T3 Code uses your only
team and a `t3-sandboxes` project unless you fill in **Team** or **Project** (a change applies to
new sandboxes; existing ones stay where they were created), and a sandbox on the
Hobby plan stops after 45 minutes, so resume it from the Sandboxes list to keep working.

Upstash is new. Create a Box API key in the Upstash Console at console.upstash.com. Upstash pauses
a box after an hour idle (six hours on paid plans) and may not count a running agent as activity,
so a long turn can stop partway and the sandbox then shows as stopped. Opening the sandbox's URL or
choosing **Resume** wakes it, and T3 Code starts again on it. Medium and Large boxes need a paid
plan. Upstash sandboxes cannot be saved as templates and show no cost.

Celesto is new. Create an API key in the Celesto console under **Settings → Security**; a scoped
key needs all three computer permissions (see, create and run, delete). Celesto never stops a
sandbox on its own, so the lifetime limit below is the only thing that stops one, and a sandbox
keeps billing while this T3 Code server is off. The free trial runs Micro only and keeps one
sandbox, stopped ones included, so delete it before you create another. Celesto keeps a stopped
sandbox's disk for 30 days. Celesto can also move a running sandbox to another machine on its own,
and does not promise to keep the sandbox's files when it does, so push work you want to keep. If a
sandbox stops answering after such a move, delete it and create a new one. Celesto sandboxes cannot
be saved as templates and show no cost.

The key is saved on the T3 Code server that provisions the sandbox, not on the client. Creating a
sandbox bills the provider account that owns the key. Stop, resume, and delete sandboxes from
**Settings → Environments → Sandboxes**; deleting removes the machine and its disk at the provider. A sandbox stops eight hours after it was created; resuming does not
reset that. Use **Extend** there to add time before it runs out, up to the lifetime limit in the
same section (24 hours by default). Once it is reached the sandbox cannot be resumed. Daytona deletes
a sandbox, files included, a day after it stops for good, so copy out anything you need before then.

That list follows the provider: a sandbox you stop or delete in the provider's dashboard shows up as
stopped or deleted within a minute, and Boat's monthly cost appears next to each sandbox. Boat keeps
a stopped sandbox's disk for 14 days; after that it shows as expired and can only be deleted.

Set up one sandbox by hand, then let the rest start ready. The checklist after creating a sandbox
offers your projects from your other machines; **Add** clones one onto the sandbox, along with the
`.env` files you pick. Install its dependencies there, then use **Save as template…** on the sandbox
in the same list, and choose the template under **Start from** when you add the next sandbox. Saving
resets T3 Code on the sandbox and deletes it once the template is ready, so each copy connects as a
new environment. Its files live on in the template, `.env` files included, so leave out secrets you
do not want in every copy; T3 Code removes only its own identity and the Claude, GitHub, and
Tailscale logins it set up.

### Private endpoints (Tailscale)

A sandbox can join your tailnet to reach an endpoint that is only on it, such as a CLIProxyAPI
server, without exposing that endpoint publicly. Each sandbox joins as its own ephemeral device,
tagged `tag:t3-sandbox`, with a single-use key; deleting the sandbox removes the device. A sandbox
that stays stopped for more than about an hour drops off the tailnet and rejoins as a new device
when you resume it.

1. In the Tailscale admin console, add the tag and let it reach only the endpoint. In the tailnet
   policy file, with your endpoint's tailnet address as the destination:

   ```json
   "tagOwners": {
     "tag:t3-sandbox": ["autogroup:admin"]
   },
   "grants": [
     { "src": ["tag:t3-sandbox"], "dst": ["100.x.y.z"], "ip": ["tcp:443"] }
   ]
   ```

   If the policy still has the default grant that lets every device reach every other one, the
   sandbox can reach your whole tailnet; narrow that grant first.

2. Create an OAuth client under **Settings → Trust credentials** (OAuth clients) with two scopes,
   **Auth Keys** (write) and **Devices → Core** (write), and select `tag:t3-sandbox` for both.
3. In T3 Code, open **Settings → Connections → Sandboxes → Tailscale**, choose **Set up**, and paste
   the client ID and secret. The secret stays on this server; sandboxes never get it.
4. When you add a sandbox, keep **Join my tailnet** checked. It is on by default when Claude's
   endpoint has a private address.

Most sandboxes get a full Tailscale connection. One that cannot create a network device runs
Tailscale in userspace instead: T3 Code then points Claude at Tailscale's local proxy, and other
programs in the sandbox reach the tailnet only through `http://localhost:1055`. Tailscale needs root
or passwordless sudo on the sandbox, which Boat, Upstash, and Vercel provide.

## T3 Connect

T3 Connect makes an environment available to your other devices without setting
up router forwarding. In the desktop app on the host, open **Settings →
Sharing & access**, sign in, and enable **T3 Connect** for that environment.

For a command-line host, run:

```bash
t3 up
```

It asks how your other devices reach the machine: T3 Connect, the local network,
or both. Choose T3 Connect and follow the sign-in instructions. On Linux and
macOS, it then runs T3 Code as a [background service](./background-service.md).
`t3 connect` is the same as `t3 up --connect`. Run `t3 up` again to change your
choice, and `t3 status` to see it.

The background service is not available on Windows, so there `t3 up` prints the
`t3 serve` command to keep running in a terminal. You can also keep the desktop
app running with its local environment enabled. Closing the desktop app's last
window stops its local server. Saving your sign-in alone does not start a server
or make the machine reachable.

On your other device, sign in to the same T3 Connect account and choose the
environment. On the app.t3.codes home page with no computer added yet, signing
in adds compatible computers linked to your account. Over SSH, the CLI prints a
browser link and a short code. Open the link on any device, confirm the code
matches, and approve. The CLI continues on its own, so you do not need to forward
an OAuth callback port.

T3 Connect renews access credentials when needed without disconnecting a healthy
connection. Pull request diffs and provider settings keep working after the
previous credential expires. A failed renewal affects that request; it does not
disconnect an otherwise healthy conversation.

### Scripts and agents

`t3 up` asks nothing when you name a choice: `--connect`, `--lan`, or their
`--no-` forms. Choices you do not name keep their settings, and `--yes` takes
the defaults. Without a terminal:

- T3 Connect sign-in prints a URL and a code. Approve it on any device.
- A needed restart runs without asking, and stops running agent turns.
- With nothing set up and no choice named, `t3 up` stops and names the flags.

`t3 status --json` prints the settings. `t3 up --help` lists every flag with
examples.

### More machines with T3 Chat

Each T3 Connect account can link up to 3 machines. Phones and browsers do not
count. A paid T3 Chat plan raises the limit to 10 machines with Pro, or 100 with
Premier.

To link T3 Chat, open your account menu on the web or desktop app, go to
**T3 Chat**, and select **Link T3 Chat**. Sign in to T3 Chat in the window that
opens and approve. The new limit applies the next time you add a machine. If you
cancel or downgrade T3 Chat, machines you already linked stay linked, but you
cannot add more until you are under the limit again.

## Pair over a LAN or private network

Use direct pairing when the other device can reach the host's network address.

On a desktop host, open **Settings → Sharing & access**, enable **Network access**,
then create a pairing link using an address the other device can reach. Changing
network access restarts the desktop app. You can turn it off in the same place.

For a command-line host, choose the local network in `t3 up`, or run:

```bash
t3 up --lan
```

For a server in a terminal, run `t3 serve --lan`. Either way, T3 Code then
accepts connections from your local network and tailnet, so a pairing code is
all that keeps other devices on them out.

If a server is already running, generate a fresh link without restarting it:

```bash
t3 pair
```

Scan the QR code on your phone or paste the pairing URL into **Add environment**
in the receiving app. Connection settings are under **Settings → Environments**
on web and desktop and **Settings → Environments** on mobile. A loopback address
such as `127.0.0.1` reaches only the device opening the link.

On a computer with the desktop app, you can open the printed `t3code://pair`
app link instead. The desktop app asks you to confirm the server address, then
adds it.

If your HTTPS endpoint uses a certificate from your own certificate authority,
install that CA on Android as a **CA certificate** in its security settings; the
Android app then trusts it.

Pairing authorizes that device for future connections. Use a fresh one-time link
for each new device; you do not need the original token to reconnect. Links
created in Settings can only be copied from the client that created them while
its Sharing & access page stays open. If you leave or reload that page, create
another link to share.

### Reach one machine several ways

A machine can have more than one route: LAN, Tailscale, another VPN, a public
URL, SSH, or T3 Connect. Tailscale shares its `100.64.0.0/10` address range with
other VPNs such as Cloudflare WARP, so an address in that range shows as VPN
unless the machine confirms it is on Tailscale. To add a route, choose **Add
route** in the machine's route list, or next to it in the T3 Connect list.
A pairing link for a saved machine is refused when it comes from an address
that machine does not have yet; add that address with **Add route** instead.
Pairing again over an address the machine already has still works. A new route
is placed by speed, in that order, and you can reorder routes at any time.

While connected through T3 Connect or a paired address, T3 Code also learns the
machine's current LAN and Tailscale addresses and adds them as routes, so
pairing once through T3 Connect is enough to use the LAN at home. When the
machine's LAN address changes, for example after it joins another Wi-Fi network,
the learned route follows it. The machine must allow network access for its LAN
address to be learned: **Network access** in the desktop app, or the
[local network](./background-service.md#local-network-access) choice in `t3 up`.
You can reorder a learned route, but not remove it; it
goes away with the route it was learned through, or when the machine stops
reporting that address.

T3 Code connects over the first route that answers. Away from home, a LAN
address that does not answer is checked briefly and skipped. It is only tried
again, after the other routes, if none of them connect. While connected over a
later route, T3 Code checks the earlier ones when your network changes, when you
return to the app, and every minute, and moves back as soon as one works.

On web and desktop, select the route count under the machine's name in
**Settings → Environments** to see its routes. Drag a route to change the order,
or remove it. On mobile, open the machine under **Settings → Environments** and
choose **Edit**. Signing out of T3 Connect removes only that route; a machine
you can still reach another way stays saved.

Open **Permissions** next to **Routes** in web or desktop, or **Your permissions**
in the mobile route details, to see what your current connection can do on that
environment. For a remote environment, this is in its route details. Permissions
shown there apply only to the route marked **In use**; other routes are not
checked. Direct pairing and T3 Connect have separate sessions and may grant
different permissions.

### Balance new threads across machines

Auto balance is off by default. On web and desktop, enable it in
**Settings → Environments → Load balancing** to automatically choose a machine for
new threads in projects grouped across connected environments. The section
appears once two or more machines are switched on.
Each machine starts at **Normal**. Choose **Prefer** to favor it when it has CPU and
memory available, **Less often** to reduce its share, or **Manual only** to exclude
it from automatic selection. These are preferences, not fixed traffic percentages.
Preferences are saved separately in each client.

The composer checks eligible machines when choosing a draft's environment, then keeps
that choice stable. Choose **Auto balance** again to check current resources, or choose
a specific machine to override it. Choosing a branch or worktree also keeps the draft
on that machine. Existing threads stay where they started. If resource checks are
unavailable or all eligible machines are full, choose a machine manually to continue.
Mobile keeps its manual environment selection.

### Tailscale HTTPS

Join both devices to the same tailnet. In the desktop app, enable **Tailscale
HTTPS** in **Settings → Sharing & access**. Turn it off there to remove that route.

To start a command-line server with Tailscale HTTPS:

```bash
t3 serve --tailscale-serve
```

For an already-running server:

```bash
t3 pair --tailscale
```

The pairing link uses an address such as `https://machine.tailnet.ts.net/`.
The mapping created by `pair --tailscale` persists across restarts. Remove its
default-port mapping with:

```bash
tailscale serve --https=443 --set-path=/ off
```

If that port is already in use, choose another with
`--tailscale-serve-port`. See `t3 pair --help` for other pairing options.

### Hosted web app

[app.t3.codes](https://app.t3.codes) needs an HTTPS endpoint. It connects directly
to your server; a hosted pairing link does not make an unreachable backend
reachable or convert HTTP to HTTPS.

For a plain HTTP LAN endpoint, use the direct pairing URL in a browser that can
open it, or pair from the desktop app. On mobile, an IP address entered without a
scheme uses HTTP, so include `https://` when your server uses HTTPS.

## Desktop-managed SSH

In the desktop app, open **Settings → Environments → Add environment**, choose
**SSH**, and enter a host or SSH alias such as `user@example.com`. T3 Code starts
or reuses a server there and opens the port forward for you. Projects, provider
credentials, and agent work stay on the remote machine.

The remote host must be Linux or an Apple Silicon Mac with `curl` or `wget`,
`tar`, `sha256sum` or `shasum`, and [provider setup](./install.md#providers).
The first launch downloads T3 Code's server to `~/.t3/runtime` on the host, so
it takes longer than later ones.
Provider CLIs must be on the `PATH` of a non-interactive login shell there;
check with:

```bash
ssh user@example.com 'sh -lc "command -v claude codex"'
```

If SSH reconnecting fails after an app update, retry the launch once. Removing
the connection stops a server that T3 Code launched; a server that was already
running is left alone.

Each desktop app keeps one session on the host for its SSH connection and reuses
it when it reconnects. Revoke sessions you no longer use in **Settings →
Sharing & access** on the host, or on a headless host with `t3 auth session list` and
`t3 auth session revoke <id>`. A desktop that can still sign in over SSH pairs
again on its next connect.

For Antigravity's Google callback on a remote host, see
[remote sign-in](./providers-antigravity.md#sign-in-from-a-remote-device).

## Browser on a remote environment

Browser tabs belong to the environment, so you and your agents see the same
tabs from any device. The desktop app shows its own environment's tabs
directly. Every other device, and the desktop app for other environments,
streams them from the host. Agents keep using them while no device is
connected, and `localhost` addresses reach servers on the host.

The first tab downloads a headless Chrome, about 120 MB, into the T3 home. It
is the same browser [HTML renders](html-renders.md) use, so a host downloads it
only once. Some Linux hosts need [setup](#browser-host-setup) before it can
start.

Agent tabs have separate storage and share a Chromium process. Take control before
typing into an agent's tab, then release control when you want the agent to
continue. Read-only connections can watch without changing the page.

While you have control, the tab works with your device: text the page copies or
cuts goes to your clipboard, a file picker on the page opens your device's
picker, and a finished download is offered for you to save. Popups such as
sign-in windows open as their own tabs. Downloads stay on the host until the
tab closes. Audio does not play on your device.

On a phone, tap the floating preview's corner dot to show its controls, then
**Pop into separate window** to keep watching in picture-in-picture over other
apps.

### Local servers

The browser lists ports held by processes your terminals and agents started.
T3 Code reads which process holds each port and never connects to it, so a
listed port opens as `http://localhost:<port>` and might not be a web page. For
an HTTPS server or a specific path, set the **Preview URL** on the project
script that starts it; T3 Code checks that address and opens it as written.

To stop listing ports, set `T3CODE_PORT_DISCOVERY=0` in the environment that
starts the T3 Code server, such as
[`service.env`](./background-service.md#configure-the-service-environment) for
the background service, and restart it. Script preview URLs still appear.

### Browser host setup

macOS, Windows, and Linux desktops run the browser as is. Some Linux hosts need
one-time setup: Ubuntu 23.10 and later block the sandbox the browser runs in,
and minimal images and containers lack libraries it loads. When that happens,
the server says so at startup, and browser tabs and HTML previews show the
command to run on the host:

```sh
sudo t3 browser setup
```

The server shows the exact line for how you started it, such as
`sudo npx t3 browser setup`, and keeps your `PATH` when Node is installed only
for your user. Where `t3` is not on your `PATH`, such as with only the
desktop app installed, it names the full path of the app's own `t3` instead. It allows Chrome's sandbox with an AppArmor profile and installs
any missing libraries and system fonts with apt; pages that load without text
can mean the host has no fonts. It is safe to run again. Without `sudo`, it only
reports what it would change.

The browser runs in Chrome's sandbox by default. Chrome cannot start that sandbox
as root. If your T3 server runs as root, run it as a nonroot user to keep
sandboxing enabled. `t3 browser setup` does not fix this root restriction.

If you need to run as root, or cannot enable the sandbox on your host, set
`T3CODE_SERVER_BROWSER_SANDBOX=0` in the **T3 server's environment** and restart
the server. This disables Chrome's sandbox. For a manual launch:

```sh
T3CODE_SERVER_BROWSER_SANDBOX=0 t3 serve
```

For a systemd service, add `Environment=T3CODE_SERVER_BROWSER_SANDBOX=0` under
`[Service]` in its configuration, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, then restart
your T3 service. Setting the variable in an agent's terminal does not change the
environment of an already running T3 server.

## Connect an outside agent

Claude Code, Codex, ChatGPT and other agents T3 Code did not start can drive
threads on an environment through its MCP server. See
[outside agents](./outside-agents.md) for setup.

## Link another environment

Link two machines, such as your laptop and a VPS, and agents on one can work on
the other: launch, message, wait on and stop its threads, answer their
questions, and manage its queues, projects and scheduled tasks.

Linked environments is a beta. Turn it on for both machines in **Settings →
Labs**; on mobile, **Settings → Labs** lists each connected machine. While it is
off on either machine, agents start nothing over a link between them. A task
already running on the other machine still finishes, and if that machine has it
off, its result arrives once it is back on.

On the machine you will work from, open **Settings → Environments → Linked environments**,
choose **Link**, and pick the other machine or enter its address. The list
holds the machines this app knows and those on your T3 Connect account. If this
app is connected to that machine with a session that manages access there, it
makes the pairing code itself; otherwise paste one from that machine's
**Settings → Sharing & access**. From a terminal, use
`t3 environment link <address> --pairing-code <code> --access <mode>`.

You can also ask an agent to link a machine by name, such as "delegate this to
my vps". It shows a card in the thread where you pick the machine the same way
and the access, then approve.

- The access you pick is the most agents from this machine may do there. An
  agent also never gets more there than its own mode here.
- Threads a link starts are marked **From** and this machine's name there.
- A full-access link works there like that machine's own agents. Below full
  access, the link's agents can change only threads it started, not that
  machine's own threads, projects or settings, and they skip its project setup
  scripts.
- The link shows up in that machine's **Settings → Sharing & access** like any
  outside agent. Revoke it there to end it. **Forget** on this machine only
  removes it here.
- Links last 30 days. Link again with a new pairing code to renew one.

An agent can also hand a task to a linked machine with `delegate_task`: it runs
there as an ordinary thread, in the project with the same repository (or the
one `target.projectId` names), and this thread wakes with its result when it
ends, as for any delegated task. It keeps following the task across restarts.
If the other machine revokes the link, or the link is removed here, the task
fails with that reason.

## Manage or revoke access

On the host, **Settings → Sharing & access** lets authorized administrators create
pairing links and revoke client sessions. Revoking an unused link prevents new
pairings; revoke a device's session to remove its existing access. Command-line
management is available through `t3 auth --help`.

A session with an open connection stays listed after its access credential
expires.

To choose a token's permissions, pass `--scope` once for each scope you want:

```sh
npx t3 pair --scope orchestration:read --scope relay:read
```

The selected scopes replace the default permissions. The same option works with
`npx t3 auth pairing create` and `npx t3 auth session issue`; each command's
`--help` lists the available scopes. Without `--scope`, pairing tokens and issued
bearer sessions get every permission, including managing access and T3 Connect.
A terminal or a full-access agent on the host can reach those as well, so a
client that should not manage access also needs to go without `terminal:operate`
and `orchestration:operate`.

To change an existing client's permissions, create a fresh pairing link with the
scopes it needs. In a browser opened directly on the environment, open that link
to replace the browser's current grant. For mobile or a saved remote environment
in web or desktop, use **Add Environment** with the fresh link or code; pairing
the same environment replaces its saved grant. Reconnecting alone does not change
permissions.

Grouping checkouts does not combine their permissions. Shared project settings
require `orchestration:operate` on every member environment; actions on one
checkout use that checkout's permissions.

`source-control:write` covers direct Git and pull request changes made from the
client: pushing, switching or creating branches, cloning, and removing
worktrees. It does not restrict what a task does. Starting a task in a new
worktree still creates that branch and worktree with `orchestration:operate`,
and the agent it runs can use Git however the environment allows.

Settings changes, provider management, environment maintenance, access
management, and T3 Connect management can each be granted separately. New
pairings without `--scope` include all of them. Existing clients keep the
permissions they paired with and can stay connected after an update, but newly
separated features may require pairing again with the permissions they need.
Older clients may show controls that the server denies. Create a fresh pairing
link to change a client's permissions.

`filesystem:read` allows browsing host files, opening workspace files, and viewing
local changes. Add `filesystem:write` to allow editing files or saving plans to
the workspace. These scopes control direct file access from the client.

To remove an environment from T3 Connect, open your account menu's **T3 Connect**
page, or **Settings → T3 Connect** on mobile, and choose **Deregister**. This
revokes its cloud access and frees its host space even when the environment is
offline or has been wiped. When T3 Connect rejects a host's link, the host
shows that it was removed from T3 Connect. To link it again, turn on
**T3 Connect** in **Settings → Sharing & access** on a desktop host, or run
`t3 connect link` on a command-line host and then restart T3 Code there. A
command-line host that released its tunnel when it last stopped may link itself
again on its next start; run `t3 connect unlink` on that host to keep it off.
Removing an environment from a device's connection settings only forgets it on
that device and doesn't change your T3 Connect account. A device keeps a saved
environment after it's deregistered until you remove it from that device.

When idle tunnel cleanup is enabled, T3 Connect removes a linked environment's
tunnel after it stays offline for several minutes. The environment stays linked
and keeps the same address. When the host starts again or wakes, T3 Connect
creates a replacement tunnel on its own. You do not need to pair again. Cleanup
usually runs five to ten minutes after the tunnel goes down.

T3 Connect also removes the tunnel of an environment running an older version of
T3 Code once it has been offline for seven days. That environment shows a message
asking you to update. Start T3 Code on that computer and update it to the latest
version; it reconnects at the same address without pairing again.

On a command-line host, `t3 connect unlink` disables exposure while retaining
your login; `t3 connect logout` also clears that login. Background-service
[removal](./background-service.md#manage-the-service) is separate.

Treat pairing URLs and authorization codes as passwords. Do not include them in
screenshots, logs, or bug reports.

## T3 Connect troubleshooting

When a T3 Connect connection fails, see
[T3 Connect troubleshooting](./t3-connect-troubleshooting.md). It explains each
error, where the problem is, and how to fix it.

## Using the Desktop App as a Remote Only

If a computer should only drive work running elsewhere, turn off its local environment. In the
desktop app, open **Settings → Environments** and switch off **Local
environment**. T3 Code restarts without a local server: no local agents or terminals run, WSL
backends stay off, and other devices can no longer connect to this computer. Your projects,
history, and saved connections are kept, and you keep working through pairing, T3 Connect, or SSH.

Switch **Local environment** back on in the same place to restart with your previous local
settings.
